GOAL
we will use technology to build a digital version of this habit tracker.

We will use an API called Pixela, developed by a Japanese developer, which is a powerful tool for habit tracking.

Pixela allows you to track habits not only by showing which days you completed your habit but also by indicating the intensity of the habit on each day.

For instance, if you want to track how many pages you read daily to build a reading habit, Pixela can display varying intensities.

On some days, you might read a lot, which will be shown with a darker color indicating a strong streak.

On other days, even if you read less, the lighter color will indicate that you still maintained the habit, albeit with less intensity.

Key Takeaways
Learned about advanced authentication methods using headers.
Explored how to make POST, PUT, and DELETE requests using the requests module.
Built a digital habit tracker inspired by Simone Giertz's physical habit tracker.
Utilized the Pixela API to track habits with intensity and visualize progress over time.

CHALLENGES
HTTP PUT requests are used to update existing data by specifying the resource endpoint and sending the new data.
HTTP DELETE requests remove existing data from the server using the resource endpoint.
Proper endpoint formatting, including username, graph ID, and date, is essential for targeting specific data points.
Authentication headers must be included in PUT and DELETE requests to authorize the operations.
